# SentimentAnalysis_VivaAerobus

Viva Aerobus, a leading low-cost airline, recognizes the importance of customer feedback in improving their services. By conducting a comprehensive sentiment analysis on passenger comments, valuable insights were gained regarding customer sentiments and opinions. The analysis involved cleaning the database to ensure accurate evaluation of sentiments expressed. Word clouds were created to visualize the most popular words in positive and negative comments, highlighting key themes and areas for improvement. Logistic regression was then applied to predict the probability of a comment being positive or negative. The algorithm performed well, as evidenced by the confusion matrix and other metrics. The analysis revealed that customers face challenges with payment methods, prices, and seating arrangements, providing a foundation for addressing these issues. The model created serves as a monitoring tool for detecting emerging problems, enabling prompt actions to be taken. The next steps include developing a systematic categorization framework, translating insights into actionable improvements, and conducting qualitative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of customer concerns and preferences. Overall, the sentiment analysis has provided valuable insights to enhance the customer experience at Viva Aerobus.
